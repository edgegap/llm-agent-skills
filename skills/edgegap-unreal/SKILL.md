description: 'Unreal Engine + Edgegap: get an Unreal multiplayer game online with dedicated servers and matchmaking, end to end. Load this before using any Edgegap MCP tool on an Unreal project: it has the Unreal workflow, Edgegap''s Unreal SDK plugin for UE 5.0-5.8 (Find Match with latency beacons, server ticket check, self-stop) with tested C++ drop-ins as fallback, source-engine and Linux cross-compile setup, server packaging, Dockerfile, matchmaker config and fixes for the pitfalls that cost hours. Use when an Unreal dev wants online play: "put my game online", "players can only join on LAN", "nobody should have to host", "click Play and get matched", listen server to dedicated server, a .uproject that needs servers, "open <ip>" connections, packaging a Linux server, or debugging Edgegap deployments, ports or matchmaking for an Unreal game. Covers C++ and Blueprint-only projects. Use even for beginners who never say Edgegap, servers or Docker. Not for Unity (edgegap-unity), Godot or non-game backends.'

# Edgegap for Unreal Engine: dedicated servers + matchmaking

Goal: a player clicks **Find Match**, the Edgegap matchmaker groups players by latency, Edgegap starts a dedicated server near them, every client connects automatically, and the server shuts itself down when the match ends. The job is done when that loop works end to end with real builds, not when the code compiles.

Use **dedicated (authoritative) servers only**; never relays. Unreal's replication is already server-authoritative, so a dedicated server is the natural fit: no player hosts, has a latency advantage, or ends the match by quitting.

**Integration: Edgegap's Unreal SDK on UE 5.0-5.8, hand-written drop-ins otherwise.** The [Edgegap SDK for Unreal Engine](https://github.com/edgegap/sdk-unreal-engine) (MIT, beta) is one plugin with the matchmaking client (beacon pings, queue, travel), the dedicated-server side (only players with a ticket for this server get in, `MM_*` readers, self-stop on exit) and an optional editor panel that builds, pushes and deploys. Use it whenever the engine is 5.0-5.8: Edgegap maintains it, and it adds the server-side ticket check the drop-ins lack. Use the drop-ins in `assets/unreal/Source/` when the engine is outside 5.0-5.8 or the team won't add a plugin. Lyra has its own path (`references/lyra.md`). Decision table and details: `references/sdk.md` §1. Tell the developer the SDK is beta and its API can still change.

Verified on **UE 5.5.4** built from source (Windows editor, Linux server on Edgegap) with the top-down template and the drop-ins, two clients, latency rules and self-stop. Also run end to end on **UE 5.8.4** with Lyra and its own plugin (Launcher editor, server built in Epic's container image, EOS sessions; `references/engine-setup.md` §6). The SDK itself ran live on Edgegap with UE 5.8 (two clients matched to one server, ticket check, build/push/deploy; 2026-11-02) and compiles with its tests on 5.0.3, 5.3.2 and 5.5.4 (`references/sdk.md` §8). The drop-ins should work on UE 5.3+; the version-specific bits (build settings, toolchain version) are called out where they appear. UE 4.27 is out of scope.

## How to work

- **Be the engineer, not a tutorial.** Inspect the project, write the code, run the builds, Docker and MCP tools, read the logs yourself. Hand the developer only what truly needs them: installers and account links, dashboard clicks, secrets, and playtesting.
- **Unreal builds are slow; plan around them.** An engine source build takes 1-3 h, the first Linux server package about 1 h, the first game launch compiles shaders for minutes. Run them in the background, say how long they'll take, and never redo one you can avoid (`references/engine-setup.md` §5).
- **One layer at a time.** Each phase ends with a check that proves it works, so when something breaks you know which layer broke.
- **Secrets.** The Edgegap **API token** and **registry token** are account secrets: never in files, code, git or chat output. The **matchmaker auth token** is client-safe by design and ships in the game, but keep real values out of public repos (`Config/UserGame.ini`, §Phase 6).
- **Money.** Deployments cost money outside the free tier. Stop the ones you start, never leave one running, and remember the free tier allows one deployment at a time, so a forgotten test server silently blocks matchmaking.
- Track the phases as a todo list; sessions are long.

## Phase 0: Understand the project (read before asking)

Inspect, don't interrogate:
- **A Lyra project** (`LyraGame`, `LyraStarterGame`, `CommonUser`, `ALyraGameMode`): follow `references/lyra.md` and the [Lyra sample](https://github.com/edgegap/game-sample-unreal-engine-lyra) (plugin, EOS sessions, a matchmaker profile per playlist) instead of the drop-ins below.
- **Betide's Edgegap Integration Kit** already in `Plugins/` (`EdgegapIntegrationKit.uplugin`, Blueprint nodes for deploys and matchmaking): a third-party Fab plugin ([betidestudio/EdgegapIntegrationKit](https://github.com/betidestudio/EdgegapIntegrationKit), support from Betide), not run by this skill. Keep it if the developer relies on it; don't add a second matchmaking integration on top of it.
- **The Edgegap SDK** already in `Plugins/EdgegapSDK` (`EdgegapSDK.uplugin`), or the drop-in files (`EdgegapMatchmakerSubsystem.*` in the game module): keep what's there. Switching from the drop-ins to the SDK means deleting the drop-ins first, since both define the same class names (`references/sdk.md` §1).
- `*.uproject`: `EngineAssociation` (a version like `5.5`, or a GUID meaning a source build), `Modules` (none means **Blueprint-only**), plugins (OnlineSubsystem*, EOS, Steam).
- `Source/*.Target.cs`: is there a `Type = TargetType.Server` target? `DefaultBuildSettings`/`IncludeOrderVersion`.
- `Config/DefaultEngine.ini`: `GameDefaultMap`, `ServerDefaultMap`, `GlobalDefaultGameMode`; `Config/DefaultGame.ini` maps to cook.
- How players connect today: `open <ip>` in the console, `ServerTravel`/`ClientTravel`, `?listen`, Sessions/OnlineSubsystem, EOS lobbies.
- Which engine is installed: a source build is required for dedicated servers (Epic Launcher builds can't build Server targets). Look for a cloned `UnrealEngine` folder or registered builds (`HKCU\Software\Epic Games\Unreal Engine\Builds` on Windows).

Then ask, in one message, only what you couldn't infer: players per match and teams, whether they have an Edgegap account, a source engine, Docker. Give recommended defaults so they can just say "yes".

**No multiplayer yet** (single-player, or nothing replicates): get two players working on a local dedicated server first and scope that honestly before touching Edgegap.

## Phase 1: Engine and toolchain

Read `references/engine-setup.md`. The developer installs (links in §1): a source build of their engine version, Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ game workloads, the Linux cross-compile toolchain matching the engine version, Docker Desktop. You do the build steps and the known fixes (§3-4): pinning the compiler when a newer Visual Studio is also installed, the missing `<chrono>` include in 5.5, building ShaderCompileWorker, short project paths on Windows. No source build wanted: build only the Linux server in Epic's container image with edgegap/buildtool-unreal-scripts (§6).

✅ Check: the editor builds, and the project's editor target compiles against that engine.

## Phase 2: Make the game dedicated-server ready

Read `references/server-ready.md`.
1. Blueprint-only project? Add a C++ module first (§1). The integration is C++; Blueprints call it.
2. Add a Server target if missing, upgrade old target build settings (§2). Set `ServerDefaultMap` and maps to cook.
3. Add the integration (`references/sdk.md` §1 decides which):
   - **SDK (UE 5.0-5.8):** copy the repo's `Plugin/EdgegapSDK` into `Plugins/`, regenerate project files, build the editor target (`references/sdk.md` §3). Server side: call `EdgegapGameMode::CheckPreLogin` from the game mode's `PreLogin`, or use `EdgegapGameModeBase` when the game has no game mode of its own (§5). The SDK stops the deployment when the server process exits, **not when the match empties**: add end-of-match code that calls `Self Stop` or exits (§5), or a finished match keeps billing until the version's max duration.
   - **Drop-ins (fallback):** copy `assets/unreal/Source/*` into the game module (`Source/<Module>/`), add `HTTP`, `Json`, `Sockets`, `Slate`, `SlateCore` to `PublicDependencyModuleNames`, and add the sections from `assets/unreal/Config/DefaultGame-edgegap.ini` to `DefaultGame.ini` with `bEnabled=False` until the matchmaker exists (`references/server-ready.md` §4). `EdgegapMatchmakerSubsystem` is the client; `EdgegapServerSubsystem` stops a matchmaker deployment once it's empty. No game mode edits, and no ticket check.

✅ Check: the editor and Server targets compile; a local dedicated server (`-server -log`) accepts a client via `open 127.0.0.1:7777` (`references/server-ready.md` §5). The SDK's ticket check stays off here: there's no `MM_TICKET_IDS` outside a matchmaker deployment.

## Phase 3: Connect to Edgegap

Read `references/deploy.md` §1. Get the Edgegap MCP connected with the developer's API token (they run the `claude mcp add` command themselves, or the plugin prompts for it). The header must be exactly `Authorization: token <uuid>`.

✅ Check: `edgegap_list_apps` succeeds.

## Phase 4: Package, containerize, push

Read `references/deploy.md` §2-4. With the SDK, the developer can instead run **Tools > Edgegap > Build and Push** (Phases 4-5 in one click, server built in Epic's image; `references/sdk.md` §7) after entering their own API token and registry credentials in the editor. When you drive the work, keep the steps below.
1. Package the Linux server with `RunUAT BuildCookRun -server -noclient -serverplatform=Linux` into `Packaged/LinuxServer` (§2). Background it; the first run is about an hour.
2. Copy `assets/docker/Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` to the repo root and replace `<Module>`/`<Project>` (§3). The Dockerfile runs the server binary directly (not the generated `.sh`) with `-stdout -FullStdOutLogOutput`; both matter.
3. `docker build --platform linux/amd64`, run it locally: the log must show `listening on port 7777` and `docker stop` must exit within seconds.
4. Developer logs Docker into `registry.edgegap.com` with the dashboard Container Registry credentials; you push with a **new tag every build** (UTC timestamp `YYYYMMDD-HHMM`, also the app version name), never reusing one (Edgegap hosts cache tags).

✅ Check: `edgegap_list_registry_tags` shows the tag.

## Phase 5: App, version, direct deploy

Read `references/deploy.md` §5-6.
1. `edgegap_list_apps` → `edgegap_create_app` if needed → `edgegap_create_app_version`: port `7777`, `UDP`, named `gameport`; 1 vCPU / 2 GB is plenty for a small map. The developer adds the **registry credentials** to the version in the dashboard; `edgegap_list_app_versions` must show `registry_credentials_set: true`.
2. `edgegap_deploy` → `edgegap_wait_for_deployment` → `edgegap_get_deployment_logs` (look for `listening on port 7777`).
3. A client connects with `open <public_ip>:<external port>`.
4. `edgegap_stop_deployment`.

✅ Check: a client played on the Edgegap server. Don't add the matchmaker on top of an unproven server.

## Phase 6: Matchmaker and client integration

Read `references/matchmaker.md`.
1. Start from `assets/matchmaker/latency.json` (latency rule, 2-4 players, short expiration, solo after 10 s) or generate with `edgegap_build_matchmaker_config`. Set `application.name`/`version`, validate, save as `matchmaker-config.json` in the repo.
2. The developer creates the matchmaker in the dashboard and sends you the **API URL** and **auth token**. Check `GET <url>/locations/beacons` with the token answers.
3. Turn the client on. Private repo: real values in `DefaultGame.ini`. Public repo: placeholders there and real values in `Config/UserGame.ini` (git-ignored, still packaged; matchmaker.md §6).
   - **SDK:** **Matchmaker Url** and **Matchmaker Token** under `[/Script/EdgegapSDK.EdgegapSettings]`. Wire the menu's button to `Find Match (<profile>)` or `FindMatch`, measuring `beacons` only if the profile has that `latencies` rule. Optionally regenerate the typed nodes from the matchmaker (`references/sdk.md` §4, §6).
   - **Drop-ins:** `bEnabled=True`, quoted `MatchmakerUrl`, `AuthToken`, `Profile`; `bSendBeaconLatencies` must match whether the profile has a `latencies` rule.
4. If the server image changed since Phase 5, rebuild, push a new tag, create a new version, and point the matchmaker at it.

## Phase 7: End-to-end test and hand-off

1. `edgegap_list_deployments`: nothing left running.
2. Launch two clients, e.g. `UnrealEditor.exe <uproject> -game -windowed -ResX=960 -ResY=540 -WinX=0 -log` and a second at `-WinX=970`. Launch one first alone to compile shaders. For an unattended run add `-EdgegapFindMatch=<profile>` (SDK) or `-FindMatch` (drop-ins), which queue at startup; otherwise the developer clicks **Find Match** in both within the expansion delay.
3. Watch the client logs, both on the same address: SDK `Queued: group …` then `MATCH FOUND: <ip>:<port>`; drop-ins `ticket … created` then `assigned to <ip>:<port>`; then `Welcomed by server`. `edgegap_list_deployments` shows one deployment tagged with both ticket IDs; its log shows two `Join succeeded` (the drop-ins also log `Started by the Edgegap matchmaker`). SDK: also check that a client without a ticket is refused (`open <ip>:<port>` gets `no matchmaking ticket`).
4. End the match. SDK: the deployment stops when your end-of-match code calls `Self Stop` or exits (server log `stopping the Edgegap deployment`); if it keeps running after both players leave, that code is missing. Drop-ins: close both clients, and about a minute later (connection timeout + 15 s grace) the deployment stops itself. Either way, this protects the developer's bill.
5. Debug with `references/troubleshooting.md` until this passes.

Hand-off: what was built and where, the app/version/matchmaker names, how to ship a new server build (package → new tag → new version → update matchmaker), free-tier caveats (matchmaker restarts every few hours, one deployment at a time, 60-minute cap), which integration is in (SDK and its commit, or the drop-ins), and next steps (a real UMG menu bound to `FindMatch` and its status event, backfill with the gate's `Allow Ticket`, a production matchmaker tier; with the drop-ins, validating ticket IDs on the server, which the SDK already does).
