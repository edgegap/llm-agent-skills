# Edgegap for Godot 4: dedicated servers + matchmaking

Goal: a player clicks **Find Match**, the Edgegap matchmaker starts a headless Godot server near the matched players, every client joins it, the server starts the match when they're all in, and it stops its own deployment when the match is over. Done means that loop works with real exports, not that the scripts parse.

Where this comes from:
- [edgegap/godot-sample-arena-shooter](https://github.com/edgegap/godot-sample-arena-shooter) (Godot 4.7.2, server-authoritative, `WebSocketMultiplayerPeer` on port 7000) ran end to end on Edgegap on 2026-10-20: two Windows clients pressed FIND MATCH, were matched onto the same deployment over `wss://` (TLS Upgrade), played, and the deployment stopped itself. Its `EDGEGAP.md` is a working reference.
- The templates in `assets/godot/edgegap/` are that sample's server lifecycle and matchmaker client made game-agnostic. They were tested on 2026-10-20 with Godot 4.7.2 in a minimal project: a Linux dedicated server export in Docker, a fake matchmaker and two clients, with both ENet (UDP) and WebSocket. Two tickets → assignment → both clients joined → `match_ready` → `match_ended` → self-stop call with the raw token. ENet on a real Edgegap deployment wasn't run yet: prove it with Phase 4 before adding the matchmaker.

Use **dedicated (authoritative) servers**, not a player host, unless the developer explicitly wants host/client.

## How to work

- **Be the engineer.** Read the project, write the code, run Godot exports, Docker and the Edgegap MCP tools, read the logs. Hand the developer only editor clicks, dashboard steps, secrets and playtesting.
- **Touch the game as little as possible.** The templates live in `res://edgegap/` and hook in with an autoload plus a few lines where the game starts its server and ends a match. That keeps upstream merges easy.
- **One layer at a time**: local (editor binary) → exported server in Docker → direct Edgegap deploy → matchmaker, each with a check.
- **Secrets.** The Edgegap API token and registry token never go into project files, git, the client, `export_presets.cfg` or chat. The matchmaker Auth Token is client-safe.
- **Money.** Tag test deployments and stop the ones you start. Free tier runs one deployment at a time.
- Track the phases as a todo list.

## Phase 0: Understand the project

Read, don't ask (`references/godot.md` §1 has the grep list):
- `project.godot`: Godot version (`config/features`), autoloads, main scene, `application/run/flush_stdout_on_print`. Godot 3 (`NetworkedMultiplayerENet`) is out of scope for the templates; the Edgegap side is the same.
- Who runs the server: a Godot client talking to a Colyseus (Node.js) server is `edgegap-colyseus`, not this skill.
- Who matches players: a Godot game whose accounts and matchmaking live in Nakama (the Edgegap Fleet Manager for Nakama starts its servers) is `edgegap-nakama`, which has its own Godot server template.
- How the game goes online: `ENetMultiplayerPeer` (UDP) or `WebSocketMultiplayerPeer` (TCP), `create_server` / `create_client`, the port, `multiplayer.multiplayer_peer =`, custom `MultiplayerAPI` branches (`set_multiplayer`). WebRTC or noray/NAT punch-through means peer-to-peer today: the server path replaces it.
- Host assumptions: a Host button that also spawns a local player for peer 1, `multiplayer.is_server()` used as "I'm a player too", UI, camera or audio code on the server, a lobby or Start button the host presses (`references/godot.md` §3).
- `export_presets.cfg`: existing presets, `export_filter` (`all_resources` or an explicit allowlist), custom features, any build script that writes presets.
- Targets: desktop clients can use ENet or WebSocket; **web exports can only use WebSocket**, with `wss://` when the page is on https.

Then ask, in one message, only what you couldn't infer: players per match, platforms, Edgegap account and Docker. Offer defaults.

## Phase 1: Make the game dedicated-server ready

Read `references/godot.md` §2-§5.
1. Copy `assets/godot/edgegap/*.gd` to `res://edgegap/`. Register `res://edgegap/edgegap_server.gd` as an autoload named `EdgegapServer`.
2. In `edgegap_settings.gd` set `TRANSPORT`, `PORT` (the game's port) and `USE_TLS` (WebSocket with TLS Upgrade).
3. Server start: where the game creates its server peer, call `EdgegapServer.begin(multiplayer)` after setting it, or let `EdgegapServer.host()` create it. In a server launch (`EdgegapServer.is_server_launch()`), the main scene starts the server at boot without a host player, and connects `EdgegapServer.match_ready` to whatever the host's Start button did.
4. Match end: call `EdgegapServer.match_ended()` when the game decides the match is over (results screen, round limit). One match per deployment; players queue again.
5. Turn on `application/run/flush_stdout_on_print=true`, or the server's logs stay empty in Docker and on Edgegap (§5).
6. Fix host-only logic: no player for peer 1 on a dedicated server, spawns for remote peers, client-only code guarded (§3).

✅ Check: `godot --headless --path . -- --server` logs `EDGEGAP listening ...` and `EDGEGAP ready ...`; two clients (`godot --path .` twice, or with `--headless` and a test env var) connect to `127.0.0.1:<port>`; the server logs `player_joined` twice and the game's server-side content runs. With `MM_TICKET_IDS='["a","b"]'` set, `match_ready players=2` fires as soon as the second joins.

## Phase 2: Connect to Edgegap

Edgegap account, Docker running, the Godot **export templates** for the exact engine version (Linux x86_64). Edgegap MCP connected (`references/deploy.md` §1).

✅ Check: `edgegap_list_apps` succeeds.

## Phase 3: Export, containerize, push

Read `references/deploy.md` §2-§3.
1. Append `assets/godot/export_presets.server.cfg` to `export_presets.cfg` (renumber the preset index). If the project uses an export allowlist, the client presets too, the new scripts must be exported: list them under `"resources"`, and switch `"scenes"` presets, which ignore listed scripts (`references/godot.md` §6). Check with `--export-pack`.
2. `godot --headless --path . --export-release "Edgegap Linux Server" build/server/server.x86_64`.
3. Copy `assets/docker/Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` to the project root; set `EXPOSE` to the port and protocol.
4. The developer runs `docker login registry.edgegap.com`; you build with `--platform linux/amd64` and push a fresh tag (UTC timestamp `YYYYMMDD-HHMM`, also the app version name).
5. Test the container with simulated Edgegap variables (`references/deploy.md` §3): two clients connect, `docker logs` shows the `EDGEGAP` lines live, and `docker stop` ends it in about a second.

✅ Check: `edgegap_list_registry_tags` shows the tag.

## Phase 4: App version and a direct deploy

Read `references/deploy.md` §4-§5.
1. Port `gameport` = `PORT`: **UDP** for ENet; **WS** with **TLS Upgrade** on for WebSocket (`tls_upgrade: true`). Registry credentials set (`registry_credentials_set: true`). Push the image before creating the version.
2. `edgegap_deploy` near the developer → `edgegap_wait_for_deployment` → logs show `EDGEGAP ready edgegap=true request_id=<id>`.
3. Two clients join `<public_ip>:<external>` (ENet) or `wss://<fqdn>:<external>` (WebSocket).
4. The server stops itself (nobody joined in 120 s, everyone left for 30 s, or the match ended), or `edgegap_stop_deployment`.

✅ Check: both played on the Edgegap server and the deployment ended on its own. Don't add the matchmaker on an unproven server.

## Phase 5: Matchmaker

Read `references/matchmaker.md`.
1. `assets/matchmaker/casual.json` (2-4 players, a 15 s expansion stage that keeps `min_team_size` at 2) with the app name and version, or `edgegap_build_matchmaker_config`. Web clients: add `allowed_cors_origins`. Save as `matchmaker-config.json` in the project root and give the developer its full path.
2. Dashboard: Create Matchmaker → upload → Create and Start → copy **API URL** and **Auth Token**.
3. `GET <API URL>/monitor` with the token answers.

## Phase 6: Client integration

1. `MATCHMAKER_URL` / `MATCHMAKER_AUTH_TOKEN` / `PROFILE` in `edgegap_settings.gd`, or `EDGEGAP_MATCHMAKER_URL` / `EDGEGAP_MATCHMAKER_TOKEN` for test runs.
2. Add `EdgegapFindMatchButton` to the menu, or drive `EdgegapMatchmaker` from the game's own button (`find_match()`, `cancel()`, `status_changed`, `assigned`).
3. Joining: `EdgegapMatchmaker.join()` connects the SceneTree's `MultiplayerAPI` and retries while the server boots. If the game has its own join function with name, address or lobby fields, call it from `assigned` instead, and **fill every field it validates**: a join the game refuses fails silently and the player looks stuck searching (`references/godot.md` §4).
4. Server changed? New export → new tag → new app version → matchmaker **Stop → Edit** `application.version` **→ Start**.

## Phase 7: End-to-end test and hand-off

1. `edgegap_list_deployments`: nothing of yours left running.
2. Export the clients (desktop presets, or Web with `wss://`).
3. Two clients, **Find Match** in both (`EDGEGAP_FIND_MATCH=1` presses it at launch): searching → match found → joining → connected, both on one server. Test with two: a lone ticket may wait until it nearly expires (30 s with the template).
4. Server logs `expected_players=2`, `match_ready players=2`, `match_ended`, `stopping reason="match over"`, `self_stop ... http=200`; the deployment disappears.
5. Debug with `references/troubleshooting.md`.

Hand-off: what was built and where, app/version/matchmaker names, how to ship a new build, free-tier caveats, and next steps (validating joiners against `MM_TICKET_IDS` or the request ID, backfill, a production matchmaker tier).
